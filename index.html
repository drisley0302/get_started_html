        <h2>My Dog Bella</h2>
      </header>
      <p>My mutt is a sweet, old girl.  She's been around for many years now - in dog years.  She's nearly 13 years old and still quite spry.  Every day Bella meets her friends at the Reservoir.  There she frolics with pups who are several years her junior.  Guess this keeps her young!</p>

        <h2>Other Things in My World</h2>
      </header>
      <p>In addition to my canine kid, I have human children, too - a son and a daughter.  They are both adults now and beginning their journeys through life. My worklife keeps me busy, so I'm often trying to find time for time with family and friends.</p>
